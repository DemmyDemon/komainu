# Throttling
To avoid mass spamming of things like `/faq`, there might be need of a throttling function.

Options:
- Per-user ignore commands after processing one.
- Globally ignore commands after processing one.
- Per-user uses-per-minute.
- Global uses-per-minute.
- Different settings for different commands.

The downside to throttling is that if it is in use for a help system, it will limit how often helpers can actually help. Perhaps some sort of excemption system needs to exist?
