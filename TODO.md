# Voting
Setting up a vote is still janky.
Will look into making it modal, and add a preamble text.

# Throttling
The first iteration is implemented.

It has "tokens" that get spent for user and channel *separately*, and they are "refunded" at a 10 second interval. Probably needs more work, but I think it has to be in actual use first.

Considering this TODONE for now.
