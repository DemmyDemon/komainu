Komainu is a Discord bot

It's not very useful, perhaps, but it's a lot of fun to build. I'm learning Go and having fun, and from where I'm sitting that makes it a great hobby.

# How do I use it?

You don't. It's useless. Wait for it to evolve into something useful.

# But pretty please!

No. I'm not going to spend time documenting it until it's more complete.

# Can I help?

You sure can. Pull requests are very welcome, and feel free to file issues.
